## Overview

- Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. It provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities.
- You will see multiple restaurants presented in different card like designs.
- To render everything beautifully, I designed a number of custom components.
- React Navigation library is used to add navigation system.
- I made an effort to mirror the design of the original app exactly.
- The app only has a frontend design at the moment, and dummy data is being pulled from a data file.
